You are provided with a claim, an accurate premise for the claim, a list of real-world fallacious premises (fallacies)
from the scientific article with the fallacy class, and relevant text exempt from this article.

Claim:
{claim}

Accurate Premise:
{premise}

{fallacies}

Article Excerpt:
{article_excerpt}

Task:
Based on the example and relevant text from the article, create {n_synthetic_entries} synthetic fallacies that
differ from the provided real-world fallacies and their class in the JSON format:
[
    {{
        "context": // Synthetic Context 1,
        "fallacy": // Synthetic Fallacy 1,
        "class": // Synthetic Class 1
    }},
    {{
        "context": // Synthetic Context 2,
        "fallacy": // Synthetic Fallacy 2,
        "class": // Synthetic Class 2
    }},
    ...
    {{
        "context": // Synthetic Context {n_synthetic_entries},
        "fallacy": // Synthetic Fallacy {n_synthetic_entries},
        "class": // Synthetic Class {n_synthetic_entries}
    }}
]

Creating fallacies of the classes different from provided real-world examples is encouraged,
but the class could be only from the fallacy inventory.

{fallacy_inventory}

Structure created fallacy text similarly to real-world examples.
