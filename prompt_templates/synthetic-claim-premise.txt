    {{
        "premise": // Synthetic Accurate Premise 1,
        "claim": // Synthetic Claim 1,
    }},
    {{
        "premise": // Synthetic Accurate Premise 2,
        "claim": // Synthetic Claim 2,
    }},
    ...
    {{
        "premise": // Synthetic Accurate Premise {n_synthetic_entries},
        "claim": // Synthetic Claim {n_synthetic_entries},
    }}
]

Structure created claims and accurate premises text similarly to real-world examples.
